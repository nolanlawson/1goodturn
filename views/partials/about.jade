        p One Good Turn is founded on the idea that we can improve the world a little bit at a time.
        p The premise is simple: you anonymously report a good deed that you did, and others can vote it up or
          | down based on how it touches their heartstrings.
        p The good deed could be anything: holding the door open for someone, yielding a seat on a bus, or giving your unused toys to a child.
          | Whatever you did to brighten someone's day, let the world hear about it.
        p The anonymity is key: this isn't for glory or boasting.  It's just decent folk showing each other a little kindness.

          | The name "One Good Turn" is inspired by the Boy Scout slogan: 
          a(href='http://www.usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsslogan.asp') Do a Good Turn Daily
          | . Scouts and non-scouts alike should agree that this is a good code to live by.
        p Created by Nolan Lawson and Peter Rizov with lots of love for our fellow men and women.
